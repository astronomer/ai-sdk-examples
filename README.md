# Overview

This Astro CLI project demonstrates how to use the [Airflow AI SDK](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow-ai-sdk). It contains a collection of sample DAGs that use the AI SDK for a variety of use cases:

- Generating personalized outbound emails (`@task.llm` with text output)
- Github changelog summarization (`@task.llm` with text output)
- Summarizing and extracting information from product reviews (`@task.llm` with structured output)
- Support ticket triage and routing (`@task.llm_branch` with structured output)
- Agent web search to mimic deep research (`@task.agent` with tools)

# Run Your Project Locally

1. Start Airflow on your local machine by running `astro dev start` with the [Astro CLI](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli).

This command will spin up 4 Docker containers on your machine, each for a different Airflow component:

- Postgres: Airflow's Metadata Database
- Webserver: The Airflow component responsible for rendering the Airflow UI
- Scheduler: The Airflow component responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks
- Triggerer: The Airflow component responsible for triggering deferred tasks

2. Verify that all 4 Docker containers were created by running 'docker ps'.

Note: Running 'astro dev start' will start your project with the Airflow Webserver exposed at port 8080 and Postgres exposed at port 5432. If you already have either of those ports allocated, you can either [stop your existing Docker containers or change the port](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/troubleshoot-locally#ports-are-not-available-for-my-local-airflow-webserver).

3. Access the Airflow UI for your local Airflow project. To do so, go to http://localhost:8080/ and log in with 'admin' for both your Username and Password.

You should also be able to access your Postgres Database at 'localhost:5432/postgres'.

# Deploy Your Project to Astronomer
